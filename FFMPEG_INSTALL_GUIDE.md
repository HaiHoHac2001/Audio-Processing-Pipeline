   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
   ```
3. Install FFmpeg:
   ```powershell
   choco install ffmpeg
   ```

## Method 2: Manual Installation
1. Download FFmpeg from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows
2. Extract the zip file to a folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`)
3. Add `C:\ffmpeg\bin` to your system PATH:
   - Open System Properties â†’ Environment Variables
   - Edit the PATH variable and add `C:\ffmpeg\bin`
   - Restart your command prompt/PowerShell

## Method 3: Using winget

winget install ffmpeg
```

## Verify Installation
After installation, verify FFmpeg is working:
```powershell
ffmpeg -version
```

## Run the Complete Pipeline
Once FFmpeg is installed, you can run the complete pipeline:
